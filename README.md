Making your Boston commute and travel easier by the day

## Getting Started

Have you ever walked into a station just to find out that the next train doesn't come for 10 more minutes?

Have you ever had to decide between taking the T or walking to your destination, and wanted to know when the next train arrived at the station?

Have you ever swiped into a station just to find out that a shuttle bus is temporarily replacing the subway?

meTro is a Boston MBTA assistant that provides real-time updates of all of the subways operating in Boston.

meTro provides easy access to arrival times of your favorite stops as well as alerts and delays.
